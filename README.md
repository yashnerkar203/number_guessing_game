# number_guessing_game
The provided code is a simple number-guessing game implemented in Python. The player is prompted to enter their name at the beginning, and then the game begins. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has six chances to guess the correct number.

The game provides feedback to the player after each guess. If the guess is lower than the generated random number, the program informs the player that the number is greater and displays the number of remaining chances. Similarly, if the guess is higher, the program informs the player that the number is lesser and again displays the number of remaining chances. If the player correctly guesses the number within the given chances, a congratulatory message is displayed.

After finishing a game, the program asks the player if they want to play again. If the player chooses to continue, a new game starts. If not, the program exits, and a closing message is displayed.

Overall, this code provides a basic number-guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts. It offers an interactive and engaging experience for players to test their guessing skills.
